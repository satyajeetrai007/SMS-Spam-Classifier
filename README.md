## Overview
This project is an SMS Spam Classifier that uses machine learning techniques to distinguish between spam and ham (non-spam) messages. The classifier analyzes the content of SMS messages and predicts whether they are spam or legitimate.

## Features
#### Spam Detection: Automatically identifies and filters out spam messages.
#### High Accuracy: Achieved 97.09 Percent accuracy and 100 percent Precision Using Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier (MNB).
#### User-Friendly Interface: Simple interface for inputting messages and receiving classification results.

## Technologies Used
#### Python: The main programming language used.
#### Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
#### Matplotlib and SNS - Visualisation tools Used.
#### Scikit-Learn: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
#### NLTK: For natural language processing tasks.
